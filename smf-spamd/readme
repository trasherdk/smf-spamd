It uses advanced statistical and heuristic tests to identify SPAM built
into spamd.

  Features:

    - friendly hosts/networks whitelist;
    - SMTP AUTH support;
    - scanning of e-Mail messages less than certain size;
    - scan results header builder;
    - probable SPAM e-Mail messages Subject tagging;
    - probable SPAM e-Mail messages quarantine and collector;
    - blocking of the extra SPAM e-Mail messages at the DATA stage of SMTP session.

Install
=======
  Requirements: Linux/FreeBSD, Sendmail v8.11 and higher compiled with MILTER
support enabled, Sendmail Development Kit, POSIX threads library, SpamAssassin.

  Make sure that the spamd daemon is configured and started.

  Edit the Makefile according to version of your Sendmail program and OS.
Edit the smf-config.h file if it is necessary (WHITE_LIST, CONTACT_ADDRESS,
TAG_SUBJECT, COPY_SPAM, REDIRECT_SPAM and SPAM_BOX parameters).

  Under the root account:
make
make install
/usr/local/sbin/smf-spamd

  Add this milter to start-up scripts before starting the Sendmail daemon.

  Add these lines to your Sendmail configuration file:
define(`confMILTER_MACROS_HELO', confMILTER_MACROS_HELO`, {verify}')dnl
define(`confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM', confMILTER_MACROS_ENVFROM`, {msg_size}')dnl
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`smf-spamd', `S=unix:/var/smfs/smf-spamd.sock, T=S:1m;R:1m')dnl

Rebuild your Sendmail configuration file and restart the Sendmail daemon.

  Under Linux add this line to your syslog.conf file and restart the Syslog daemon:
local3.*	-/var/log/spam.log

  Under FreeBSD run this command: touch /var/log/spam.log
Then, add these lines to your syslog.conf file and restart the Syslog daemon:
!smf-spamd
local3.*	-/var/log/spam.log

If you want to log only SPAM e-Mail messages, set the syslog priority to the notice.

In the quarantine mode the probable SPAM e-Mail messages will be redirected to the
specified quarantine mailbox. All envelope recipients will be removed, and inserted
into original e-Mail message as X-Original-To: headers.

Notes: the successfully authenticated senders will bypass the filtering.
